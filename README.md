# Real-Time Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview
This project is part of the ID2221 Data-Intensive Computing course. It involves designing and implementing a real-time data streaming system for sentiment analysis on political tweets. The system utilizes Hugging Face's transformer library to perform sentiment analysis and Apache Spark to handle a data stream.

This repository contains a demo of a data intensive application. The application is a complete data pipeline that ingests data from a source, processes it, and stores it in a database. The application is implemented in Python and uses the following technologies:
- [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) for the message broker
- [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) for the data processing
- [Transformer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index) for sentiment analysis
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for the database
