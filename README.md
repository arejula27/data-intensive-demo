# Data intensive demo

This repository contains a demo of a data intensive application. The application is a complete data pipeline that ingests data from a source, processes it, and stores it in a database. The application is implemented in Python and uses the following technologies:
- [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) for the message broker
- [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) for the data processing
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for the database
